# Coal

It turns out that the ground right underneath the surface is a good place to find coal deposits.

Coal spawns randomly in horizontal sheets that are 1 block thick. The sheet size will grow in proportion to your world size, so you may want to increase it to find more coal!

The following program is a good starting point for finding coal. It digs down in search of a coal sheet, then digs to its east and west in hopes of finding more coal.
