# Jumping

Your drone has unlocked the `jump()` command.

This command allows you to target certain unlocks and jump forward to them. It is especially useful for debugging or jumping forward to an ore vein that you have recently missed. You use it by passing it an unlock as an argument, such as `Unlocks.Iron`.

It's not guaranteed that jumping will bring you directly to the target unlock, so you might still have to look around a bit, but it is guaranteed that the target is nearby.

`jump()` can only be used once per script. If you have multiple drones, `jump()` cannot be used inside functions that are being executed by spawned drones.
