# Import
Putting all your code in a single file quickly becomes unmanageable. 
`import` statements allow you to import functions and global variables from another file.
How it works in one screenshot:
![](ImportsInOnePicture400)

Here `import module2` runs the file named `module2` and gives you access to all its globals.
You can then access variables and functions within the imported module using the `.` operator.
So in this example, `module2.print_x()` calls `print_x()` in `module2`.

### No Need to Read Further

You can also move the globals from the imported module into the current scope where the import statement is executed using the `from` syntax.

`from module2 import print_x
print_x()`
Imports only the specified globals from `module2`.

or

`from module2 import *
print_x()`
Imports all globals from `module2`.

This also imports the `module2` file, but instead of accessing it through a variable named `module2`, it unpacks the globals from `module2` and assigns them directly in the local scope.

This form of import is usually not recommended because it doesn't work well when two files import each other, and you may accidentally overwrite variables in the importing file due to name collisions. It's safer to avoid the `from` syntax if you don't know what you're doing.

# How it really works

## TL;DR
Imports can be quite unintuitive, but most problems can be avoided by sticking to the `import file` syntax instead of `from file import`, and wrapping everything that isn't a global definition in
`if __name__ == "__main__":`

## Import Side Effects
The first time you import a file, the game executes the entire file and then gives you access to all variables defined during that execution.
If you import the same file again, it returns the module cached during the first import.

This means that import statements can have side effects. If you import a file that calls `harvest()`, it will actually harvest during the import. But when you import it again, it won't harvest again because the file is only run once.

There is a way to avoid such side effects using the `__name__` variable. This is a variable that is automatically set to `"__main__"` when a file is run directly, and to the name of the file when a file is run through `import`.
It is considered good practice to put any code that you don't want to run when the file is imported inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

A common file structure in Python is to put the code that should be executed when the file is run into a `main()` function. This way you have a clear distinction between local variables (defined inside `main()`) and global variables that can be imported (defined outside `main()`).

`a_global_variable = "global"

def main():
    a_local_variable = "local"
    # do things

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()`

## Import Cycles
What happens if file `a` imports file `b` and file `b` imports file `a`?

file `a`:
`import b
x = 0`

file `b`:
`import a
def f():
    print(a.x)`

This will work fine. Let's say neither of the two files are loaded yet, and someone else executes `import a`.

- `a` runs until the `import b` line.
- `b` runs until the `import a` line.
- The module `a` already exists, but doesn't contain `x` because it has only reached the `import b` line.
- `b` stores a reference to the half-loaded module `a` in a variable called `a`.
- `b` runs the `def` statement and stores the function `f()`.
- `a` continues to run and initializes `x`.

When someone calls `b.f()` it will correctly print `0` because the module `a` that `b` has a reference to is now fully loaded.

Now consider the same code using the `from` syntax.

file `a`:
`from b import *
x = 0`

file `b`:
`from a import *
def f():
    print(x)`

- `a` runs until the `from b import *` line.
- `b` runs until the `from a import *` line.
- The module `a` already exists, but hasn't been fully executed yet.
- `b` unpacks everything that is currently in `a` into its own global scope. At this point, `a` contains nothing because it hasn't reached the `x = 0` line yet, so nothing is imported.
- `b` runs the `def` statement and stores the function `f()`.
- `a` continues to run and initializes `x`.

If someone now calls `b.f()`, they will get an error that `x` doesn't exist in the current scope. This is because this time `b` does not have a reference to the still-loading `a` and does not see definitions that were added after the import.
